## Vision Statement
Food delivery apps have become extremely popular today as they allow users to quickly and conveniently order ready-made meals from restaurants directly to the office or home. While pizza delivery is a relatively new business model, on-demand pizza delivery apps are rapidly gaining popularity among users around the world. With such an application, customers can receive their pizza within 20-30 minutes of placing an order. Thus, it becomes clear that high-quality mobile delivery is vital for pizzeria owners to attract more customers.

This Pizza ordering system(POS) will allow users to order pizzas and other side items through the app for takeout. It will be similar to any online pizza ordering system such as Pizza Hotline or Pizza Pizza. The user would be able to visually select toppings and other food items to customize their pizza. 

This application is designed for customers that want to order takeout pizza from a restaurant. It will include menus for special (pre-made) pizzas along with a custom pizza option. The menus would be detailed to show whatâ€™s included on each pizza such as dietary restrictions or allergy info. The user can also schedule an order ahead of time to be ready for a specific time in the day. 

The application will provide a quick and seamless ordering system for users. It will provide a visual experience that will enable users to keep track of their order from start to finish and notify them when it is ready. This will save time for both the users and the restaurant and enable users to pick up their order immediately when it is ready. The application will allow the user to save their favourite pizzas to allow them to reorder the same pizza faster. The user will also be able to see their previous orders that were placed to quickly reorder it again. 
The system will initially be a standalone application, but in the future, it will be accessible to all users via the Internet. It will be created for the pizza but will be adaptable to other restaurants
The success criteria will be measured based on the number of downloads of the app and an increase in the number of orders placed through the app.
