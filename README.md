## Description
Food delivery apps have become extremely popular today as they allow users to quickly and conveniently order ready-made meals from restaurants directly to the office or home. While pizza delivery is a relatively new business model, on-demand pizza delivery apps are rapidly gaining popularity among users around the world. With such an application, customers can receive their pizza within 20-30 minutes of placing an order. Thus, it becomes clear that high-quality mobile delivery is vital for pizzeria owners to attract more customers.
